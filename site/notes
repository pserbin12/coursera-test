make nav links hover
space background?
mountains background?
path background 



make it so that the text goes down? make other page more like the blog example






make the next page with the books banner and the about me thing in a box with the text over it with smaller opacity
text on the left and pic of me on the right in a circle like the blog about building a bed 
and then link about connect with me on the bottom 
background of the other page should be the bright yellow color, but muted with layers (?)
or white background with neat text and pictures












changed to inline-block

took out text-align in .navbar 


background size for layer is cover 
get rid of text aligns for nav divs
bring back center for .navbar





next commit:changed display back to block instead of inline bc that's what seems to make it in a list format?
