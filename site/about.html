	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>Hey there, I'm Paige. I like coding, linguistics, learning new things, dogs, and helping others to learn new things! My main focus throughout college was linguistics (with a minor in German), but now I'm doing something a little different. I'm working on teaching myself coding, with the hopes of being able to do Natural Language Processing (NLP)</p>
